    "Rainfall in many dryland ecosystems exhibits pronounced variability from year to year. Because rainfall occurs intermittently and with a low degree of predictability, we often are forced to characterize the occurrence and amount of rainfall in terms of **probability**. In this exercise, we will investigate the probabilistic nature of rainfall at various locations in Kenya. We will use these data to explore the concepts of probability and conditional probability, as well as probability density functions and cumulative density functions. We will use these data to develop a stochastic model of rainfall that can be used to generate  novel time series of rainfall and develop inference into the likelihood of various daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual rainfall totals. \n",

    "Let's make a very simple model of rainfall that assumes a Poisson process (i.e. a memoryless process). We just saw that this approach is probably too simple, and later we will look at how we could improve the model. But it helps to start with the most simple approach and then add complexity as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model will be built with the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The probability of an \"event\" (i.e. rainfall) occuring on any given day is given by the parameter $\\lambda_r$, which has units day$^{-1}$\n",

To get these monthly $\\lambda_r$ values, we need to determine the probability of rainfall for each month by dividing the number of rainy days per month by the total number of observations in each month, which we did in Practice 4. For now, we assume stationarity in the monthly values, which means that we are assuming that the values of $\\lambda_r$ in each month are the same through out the entire record (i.e. Jan 1938 has the same properties as Jan 2008). \n",

These types of processes allow the properties of the process to change in space and time. Our implementation ‚Äì using monthly values ‚Äì is a little clunky, and we'd prefer to have the $\\lambda$ values change more smoothly throughout the year.
