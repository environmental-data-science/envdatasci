The main concept we will be considering is mass balance. Along with energy and momentum, mass is one of the three consitutents that are conserved in environmental systems. More generally, physical systems can be written as a statement of mass, energy, or momentum. The key to creating these statements (or equations) of balance is determining the bounds of the system (its geographic extent and structure) as well as the specific processes acting across those boundaries. \n",

    "Let's take a look at a typical river basin, the upper portions of the Sisquoc River, which is a westward flowing river in northeastern Santa Barbara County, California. The Sisquoc is a tributary of the Santa Maria River, which is formed when the Sisquoc River meets the Cuyama River at the Santa Barbara County and San Luis Obispo County border just north of Garey. The river is 57.4 miles (92.4 km) long and originates on the north slopes of Big Pine Mountain, at approximately 6,320 feet (1,930 m). Big Pine Mountain is part of the San Rafael Mountains, which are part of the Transverse Ranges.

    "## 3.1 Visualizing watersheds\n",
    "\n",
    "A watershed (or catchment, or drainage basin) is any area of land where precipitation collects and drains off into a common outlet, such as into a river, bay, or other body of water. The watershed includes all the surface water from rain, runoff, snowmelt, hail, sleet and nearby streams that run downslope towards the shared outlet, as well as the groundwater underneath the Earth's surface. Watersheds are hierarchical, which means they connect into other watersheds at lower elevations, with smaller sub-drainage basins, which in turn drain into another common outlet. This pattern of self-similar, hierarchical structures means that watersheds and their associated stream networks form a stochastic fractal network that collectively routes water and sediment over the Earth's surface. Visualizing a watershed requires defining an outlet, which identifies the lowest point of the catchment and the location through which all surface water drains. In this lab, we will define the outlet of a watershed as the location of a USGS streamflow gauge. By linking the definition of our watersheds to the location of streamflow gauges, we will be able to examine the mass balance of the watershed. Before diving into the principles of mass balance as they apply to watersheds, let's first spend a little time learning how to acquire and visualize watersheds based on the location of a USGS streamgauge.\n",

Therefore, to use any unicode value in your python strings - for example, the smiling emoji, üòÅ, which is listed as unicode symbol <code>U+1F601</code> - you would include the unicode number (<code>1F601</code>) inside an 8-digit python unicode representation that would look like this: <code>\\U0001F601</code>. The most common unicode symbols that were developed first, like the ¬∞ sign, only have 4 digits (<code>U+00b0</code>), so we must add 4 zeros before the symbol to get to a the 8-element representation that python requires: <code>\\U000000b0</code>. \n",

    "## 3.2 A Catchment as a Physical System\n",
    "\n",
    "In hydrological sciences, we use the idea of a catchment (or river basin) as the boundary of a system through which water flows. Because water has a relatively constant density (1 g H<sub>2</sub>O = 1 cm<sup>3</sup> H<sub>2</sub>O), we can measure water balance in terms of water volume (m<sup>3</sup>) in addition to water mass (10<sup>3</sup> kg). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The water balance of a catchment is determined by the sum of inputs and outputs of water. If inputs are greater than outputs, the catchment is gaining water. If outputs are greater than inputs, the catchment is losing water. In the special case where outputs and inputs are equal, the catchment is neither gaining nor losing water, and the amount of water in the catchment is constant with time, meaning it is in _steady state_. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary input of water into the land surface is through precipitation ($P$ [m<sup>3</sup>]). Precipitation usually takes the form of either rain or snow. There are two main ways that water exits a catchment: (1) the transport of water out of the catchment through streamflow (or river discharge); and (2) the transport of water back into the atmosphere in the form of vapor, which is released from either soils (evaporation, $E$ [m<sup>3</sup>]) or plants (transpiration, $T$ [m<sup>3</sup>]). For simplicity, we often combine evaporation and transpiration into a single quantity, evapotranspiration ($ET$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Having specified the important inputs and outputs, the change in storage of water in the catchment ($\\Delta S$, [m<sup>3</sup>]) can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta S = P - ET - Q $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In small basins, most of this stored water, $S$, is held in the soil. In larger basins, the storage of water in groundwater can be very important, as can the net movement of groundwater into and out of the basin. Finally, in basins where freezing conditions are common, large amounts of water can be stored as snow and ice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, we calculate the water balance over discrete time intervals, $\\Delta t$ (e.g. days, or years), in which case, the equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\Delta S}{\\Delta t} = P(t) - ET(t) - Q(t) $$\n",

The NWIS contains all station data on streamflow. In addition, it also has all federally-collected data on groundwater levels and water quality.

    "\n",
    "Evapotranspiration data is the hardest to obtain as there are very few direct observations of evapotranspiration (but we will work with some of these direct measurements in our next lab!). Because evapotranspiration is dependent on atmospheric conditions and the amount of energy available to evaporate water at the surface, most attempts to characterize evapotranspiration focus on the _potential_ rate at which water vapor can be transported from the surface into the atmosphere. However, in places where the availability of water limits the rate of evapotranspiration, the potential evapotranspiration (PET) can be much higher than actual rates. This makes determiniation of actual evapotranspiration quite difficult in water-limited regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation of actual evapotranspiration can be accomplished using either mass balance approaches, energy balance approaches, or a combination of both. For this lab, we are going to use a model-based estimate of actual evapotranspiration called the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model, which was developed at the USGS's Earth Resources Observation and Science ([EROS](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros)) Center.  This approach is presented in [Senay (2018)](https://doi.org/10.13031/aea.12614) and [Senay et al., (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1111/jawr.12057). Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no web service available for subsetting the data. Therefore, the `hydrodata` routine,  `ssebopeta_bygeom` first downloads the entire national dataset for the requested period and then subsets the data based on the provided geometry locally. For this reason, it‚Äôs not nearly fast as other operations and the bottleneck is download speed, which can vary greatly based on available bandwidth.\n",
