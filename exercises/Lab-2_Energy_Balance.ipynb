    "Much like mass balance, the energy balance of a system consists of the sum of inputs and outputs. While the mass balance terms can be discretized into obvious components (e.g. precipitation), the components of the Earth's energy budget are **fluxes**, meaning that they consist of both inputs *and* outputs and can be either positive or negative, depending on environmental conditions. These fluxes are driven by four important processes: **radiation**, **conduction**, **convection**, and **evaporation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest and perhaps most obvious component of the Earth's energy budget is the **net radiation**, $R_n$, consisting of electromagnetic radiation that is *absorbed*, *reflected*, and *emitted* by the Earth's surface. The surplus of incoming solar radiation provides excess energy for transport-driven processes at the Earth's surface. Thermal conduction of heat energy within the ground leads to **ground heat flux**, $G$. **Sensible heat flux**, $H$, refers to the turbulent transfer of energy between the surface and the atmosphere via convective processes. **Latent heat flux**, $\\lambda E$, represents the loss of energy associated with phase changes between liquid water and water vapor through evaporation, transpiration, and condensation.\n",

    "In this lab, we will be using data collected from a micrometerological tower that uses [eddy covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_covariance) techniques to measure turbulent fluxes in the atmospheric boundary layer. The physics of this method are too complex to get into here, but eddy covariance is one of the main ways of determining landscape energy balance. These \"flux towers\" are equipped with sensors to measure wind speed and direction and gas (usually H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations, and radiation (and usually numerous other sensors!) at very high frequencies (commonly 10 Hz or 10 times per second). These data are then used to calculate fluxes of gas, energy, and momentum across the landscape. \n",
