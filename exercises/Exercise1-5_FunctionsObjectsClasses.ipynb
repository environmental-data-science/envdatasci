    "In order to effecitvely use Python, we need to learn how to use functions and classes. **Function**s are a fundamental part of almost any programming language, and Python is no different. We have already been introduced to many of the excellent builtin functions that are part of the standard Python library. However, as you develop your own analyses, you will  need to be able to author your own functions. These functions will allow you to create stand-alone pieces of code that perform consistent operations on input data. **Classes** are even more versatile than functions. They are present in almost all object-oriented programming languages and provide a means to bundle functions and data together. Defining a new **class** creates a new type of **object** (recall that objects are the fundamental building block of Python), allowing new instances of that object type to be made. \n",

    "A function is simply a set of instructions that you wish to use repeatedly on varying data. Sometimes a function is used to group a complex set of instructions that allows you to compartmentalize your code in ways that improve its readability. There are three types of functions in Python: **builtin** functions, **user-defined** functions, and **anonymous** functions. We have already seen many **builtin** functions, and you will meet many more in the coming weeks. This exercise focuses on **user-defined** and **anonymous** functions, both of which are important for advanced data analysis. \n",

    "A UDF is created using some very specific syntax. First, a function is delcared using the `def` keyword. The name of the function - and any arguments it takes - follows the `def` keyword, followed by a `:`. The combination of `def` and `:` is a similar construction to other control statements in Python that you've already seen, such as `for` + `:`, and `if` + `:`. The code block below is the simplest possible function.\n",

    "<div class=\"python\">\n",

Just like the concept of <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Biography-Dangerous-Charles-Seife/dp/0140296476>`0`</a>, the concept of <code>None</code> will turn out to be quite useful!\n",

As the note above indicates, the `return` statement isn't necessary in Python functions; they will just automatically return `None` if you don't specify otherwise. However, using the `return` statement is required if you ever want to work with any output from your functions.   \n",

The ability to (1) pass an **argument** into a function, (2) **transform** data within - or based on - the value of a function argument, and (3) **return** some new data or result based on those manipulations. These three factors combine to make functions extremely useful.

    "In both `convert_temp_to_C` and `convert_temp_to_K`, the order of parameters is very important. If we tried calling the `convert_temp_to_C` function like this: `convert_temp_to_C('F', 212.0)` we would get an error! The reason we get an error is because the function definition assumes that the _first_ argument should be mapped to the first parameter `temp` and the _second_ argument should be mapped to the second parameter `unit`. That's why the `TypeError` refered to `temp_F`as a `required positional argument` in the section above. This assumption that arguments be mapped to parameters in a specific order can make working with complicated functions that have many parameters almost impossible. For this reason, Python provides the ability to pass **keyword arguments** to functions. \n",

    "In the example above, we saw how to create an **instance** of a Temperature. But you probably noticed that _every_ instance of our class will have the same temperature and unit: `74.0` degress `F`. While it's possible to change these values later (in python parlance, we'd say \"after the object is _instanced_\"), it'd be better if we could **initialize** our class instances with the values we want. To do this, we will create our first class method, the `__init__` method.\n",
    "\n",

    "The `__init__()` method is a special function that we create for classes that tells python how to create a new instance of the class. This function is included as part of a class's definition, and usually should be the **very first method** that appears in the class. \n",

    "### Why `self`?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not at all obvious why we need to add an extra parameter (which, by convention is always called `self` ) to the initializer method. Even weirder is the fact that we need to add this extra parameter, `self` to _every_ class method! To beginning Pythonistas, the concept of `self` is deeply strange. However, there is a fairly straight-foward reason for its existence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python functions ‚Äì like functions in most programming languages ‚Äì can only manipulate data that exist within the function itself. Speaking generally, Python functions aren't supposed to manipulate data that they haven't been passed via argument. The consequences of this \"separation of namespaces\" is that ‚Äì paradoxically ‚Äì a class method can't operate on class data unless the class data _itself_ is passed into the method!  \n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, we use the `self` parameter to allow us to work with the properties of a class within our class methods. If we didn't include this extra parameter, the functions that we write _inside_ of a class wouldn't even be able to access the attributes of the class that they were inside of! \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, you can think of `self` as a placeholder for a class instance. In fact, Python **automatically passes a class instance** into any class function whenever that class function is called. The class instance argument is inserted by Python before any other arguments. Therefore, we include the `self` parameter at the beginning of every class method (remember _methods_ and _functions_ are the same thing), knowing that Python will pass a class instance into our function first, and all of the attributes of that instance will get assigned to the `self` parameter. \n",

Because the use of `self` in Python is such a confusing concept, there have also been [formal proposals](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=239003) to get rid of `self` and [warnings about its misuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdOhwPovkHI) in popular culture.

Be sure to come back to these notebooks for refreshers whenever necessary. And of course, don't forget to explore all of these topics in _Learning Python_.\n",
