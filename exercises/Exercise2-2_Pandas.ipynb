    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) (\"Python Data Analysis Library\") is arguably the most important tool for data scientists using Python. Built on NumPy, pandas is a widely used Python package that provides tools for data wrangling and analysis. The basis of the pandas library is that it takes data (such as a `.csv` file or `SQL` database) and creates a `DataFrame`: a Python object with rows and columns that looks very similar to tables in other software. With this DataFrame, you can perform a variety of tasks, from viewing and inspecting the data to plotting, analysis, and exporting, and everything in between.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As the central component of the Python data science toolkit, pandas is essentially where your data will \"live\" when you're working in Python. Pandas is built on [NumPy](https://numpy.org), which means that many of the data structures of NumPy are used in pandas. Data stored in pandas `DataFrame`s are often analysed statistically in [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/), visualized using plotting functions from [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), and fed into machine learning algorithms in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will cover the basics of pandas, including `DataFrame` construction, importing data with pandas, `DataFrame` attributes, working with `datetime` objects, and data selection and manipulation. While this tutorial is designed to give you an overview of pandas, the [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) should the first place you look for more detailed information and additional pandas functionality. The pandas documentation is particularly well-written, making it easy to find methods and functions with numerous examples. Make the docs your best friend! 🐼\n",

    "<hr style=\"border-top: 0.2px solid gray; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 1px\"></hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "The core components of pandas are the `Series` and the `DataFrame` objects. Both of these are essentially enhanced versions of the NumPy array, with a few key differences: 1) pandas DataFrames can be *heterogeneous*, meaning that the columns can contain different data types; and 2) the rows and columns of DataFrames can be identified with labels (usually strings) in addition to standard integer indexing. \n",
    "\n",
    "A `Series` is essentially a column of data, while a `DataFrame` is a multidimensional table made up of many `Series`, not unlike a spreadsheet:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/series+dfs.png\" alt=\"dfs\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Series and DataFrames are similar in many respects – most common operations can be performed on both objects, though Series are more limited, as they can only ever contain a single column (i.e. you cannot turn a `Series` into a `DataFrame` by adding a column).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `Series` and `DataFrame` objects contain an `Index` object similar to the row index of the `ndarray` or the index of a list. The pandas `Index` object can be conceptualized as an immutable array or an ordered multiset. Unless explicitly defined otherwise, the `Index` of a `Series` or `DataFrame` is initialized as the ordered set of positive integers beginning at 0 (see figure above).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating `Series` and `DataFrame` objects from scratch\n",

Pandas has a few different functions to import flat files, but perhaps the most useful is the `pd.read_csv()` function, designed to read CSV files.

However, there are occasions when the bracket notation proves particularly useful. For example, you could access each column in a DataFrame by iterating through `df.columns`, which returns an `Index` object containing the column names as `str` objects that can be directly passed to the index operator. Additionally, you may find it useful to use the double bracket syntax to return a `DataFrame` object, rather than a `Series`, which can only ever contain a single column of data.\n",

The standard [**`datetime`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) library is the primary way of manipulating dates and times in Python, but there are additional third-party packages that provide additional support. A few worth exploring are [**`dateutil`**](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), an extension of the datetime library useful for parsing timestamps, and [**`pytz`**](http://pytz.sourceforge.net), which provides a smooth way of tackling time zones.\n",

    "By default, pandas concatenates along the *row* axis, appending the values in `df2` to `df1` as new rows. However, notice that the original index values have been retained. Since these index labels do not contain useful information, it would be best to reset the index before proceeding. This can be done in one of two ways. First, we could have passed `ignore_index=True` to the `pd.concat()` function, telling pandas to ignore the index labels.
